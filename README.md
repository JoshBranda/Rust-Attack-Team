This is a game.... or is it? 

In either case, no crabs were harmed in the making of this application.

## Installation
`TBD`

### MAC
Install SDL2 with the brew package manager like so:

`brew install sdl2`

which should build and install SDL2, header files and any dependencies.

## Running
The first time you run it, you will either need to copy the resources folder next to src into target/debug, or run our script with ./run.sh (which copies the folder and uses cargo run).  After the first time, you only need to do cargo run.
